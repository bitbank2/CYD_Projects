## CYD_Projects
A collection of Arduino sketches for the various ESP32+LCD PCBs which we collectively call "Cheap Yellow Displays". Not every project is targeted to run on every permutation of CYD. My 2 favorite flavors are the original (2.8" ILI9341 w/resistive touch) and the JC4827W543 (4.3" 480x270 S3 w/resistive touch).
Please feel free to add your own projects and improve the documentation.
